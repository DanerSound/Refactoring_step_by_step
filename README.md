# Refactoring_step_by_step

The main pourpose of this repo is to exercise my self using the book, "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler 

I'll use Python, insted of javascript, because i know know JS yet but will learn it some day. ( i hope!... )

I will develop all the chapters alongside the verification tests that he requires, I will try to apply the TTD approach.
